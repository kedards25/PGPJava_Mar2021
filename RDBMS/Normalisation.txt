	it cannot have duplicate values
	it cannot have null values 


Alternate Key

Normalisation
	Refers to spliting complex data structure into simple table structures based on some 	conditions.it helps reducing redundancy in table.
	Redundancy is duplicacy of data.
	

Functional Dependency
	Attribute(column) A is functionally dependent on Attribute(Column) B if and only if
	,there is exactly one value of A for each value of B

	A->B->C
	A->C
