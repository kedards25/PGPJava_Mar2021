OOPS
Object Oriented Programming System
it is based on classes and objects

Object
	any real world thing around us
	has properties and functionality

	OOPS		Real World Term		Technical Term
	state		properties/attributes	variables
	behavior	functionality		methods
	identity	unique thing		constants

	Two objects can have same state and behavior but will never have same identity

	Objects can communicate with each other via messages,action performed by an object in response to the message given by other object is called as method

	an object is instance of a class

Classes
	classes are collection of objects with same state and behavior or objects belonging to 	particular class exhibit state and behavior of mentioned class
	
	classes are groups of real world objects and classes are conceptual

	Association due to which two or more objects communicate with 	each other is called as relation

	Types of Relationships
	Composition
		one thing is made up of another
		CPU-Motherboard
		 ------>has---------->
		a			b
		 <------part of<------

	Utilisation
		one thing uses other
		driver and car
		
		driver uses a car

	Instantiation
		Class and object
		is-a
		kind-of
		

	Generalisation
		Many classes with similar behavior and properties
