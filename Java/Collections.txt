Wrapper classes are used to wrap primitive data types as its object
int=>Integer
float=>Float


emp=>Employee

Demo<Employee> demo=new Demo();




Integer intgr=new Integer(1000);

int val=1000;

intgr=val;	//Auto-Boxing

val=(int)intgr;	//Auto-Unboxing

Collection is an interface which stores object of same types
Collection helps us to deal with objects of Generic class provided as a param

class Employee
{
	int empId;
	String empName;
	String empAddr;
	String dept;
	long contactNo;

}

class Demo
{


main()
{
	Demo<Employee> demo=new Demo();
}

}

//object of demo class is referring to objects of type Employee

size of Collection elements can grow or shrink dynamically(dynamic array)

	duplicate values are not allowed
	Can grow or shrink as per requirement
Map
	Key-value pair
	arranges data based on key

Stack
	works on LIFO(Last In First Out)

Queue
