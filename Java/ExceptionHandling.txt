Compile Time	=>syntax errors
Logical		=>Mistake in bulding Logic only
Runtime		=>Error may or may not occur

Exception class is parent class for all the classes used for exception handling
Whenever an error occurs ,an exception is thrown by compiler


We need to use try-catch block to handle exceptions in the code.

Types of Exceptions 
	Checked Exceptions
			Compiler will indicate the expected error and will suggest the way to handle 			the error

	Unchecked Exceptions
			Compiler will not be aware of the expected error and will not suggest the 			way to handle the error	thereby causing the code to crash


	ArithmaticException
	ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
	NullPointerException
	IllegalAccessException
	ClassNotFoundException
	FileNotFoundException

Try with Resources
	
	eliminates the need of lengthy finally block by closing the opened resources in try block 	itself

	We can open multiple resources as well using try with resources

	the resources need to be separated with ';'

	the opened resources will be closed in opposite order in which they were opened
	
	try(//ConnectionString to Connect External Resource)
	{
		
	}
	catch()
	{
	}
