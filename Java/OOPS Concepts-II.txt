OOPS

Benefits of OOPS
	Realistic Modelling
	Re-usability
	modularity
	information hiding

any language that follows OOPS must possess following characteristics

Abstraction
	Showing relavant data to user
Encapsulation
	Hiding unneccessary data from the user

If abstraction is there then encapsulation must be there
Abstraction and Encapsulation goes hand in hand

Inheritance
	Implementation of Generalisation
	e.g.
		Vehicle=> Generalised class
		Car=>Specialised class derived from Vehicle class
	helps in implementing re-usability

	Types of inheritance
		Single
			One parent->One Child
			
		Multiple
			More than one parent->One or more children classes

		Multi-Level
			Parent of one class would be child of another class
			A-->B--->C


Polymorphism
	Greek Words
	Poly=Many
	Morphos=forms

	One thing exhibiting in more forms
	e.g.Mobile
