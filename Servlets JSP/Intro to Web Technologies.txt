					CGI(Common Gateway Interface)
						it used to receive requests from clients and treat 						each request as separate process,though it is coming 						from same client,it would lead to late response time 						thereby poor performance of website

					Servlets
					to overcome the drawbacks of CGI,java developed a technology 						called as servlets,which was functioning as same as CGI but 
					was treating each request as a single thread


					JSP[Java Server Pages]
