Demo d=new Demo();
int ans=d.add(5,7);
//assertEquals(expected,actual);
assertEquals(12,ans);


class Demo
{
	int add()
	{
		return a+b;
	}


	void disp()
	{
		in sum=add();
	}
}

to run some java projects we require to download jar files(also known as dependencies)
which could be machine/computer bound,to avoid this computer bound dependencies we have
a dependency management tool called as maven
